## Description

This is my first android app to use VS Xamarin to program.
Hard to do it as I'm new to Android programming.

####This apps intended to show some pictures for my kids to view.
#### Nothing special but at least successfully implement the task.

Current limited function:

>A splash screen show out and then showing numbers of static pictures

Hope I could have chance to make it more usable by adding in more features.

>select desired folder to show images inside the folder

>select desired type of photos ( such as different type vehicles ... etc), aim could at least give little idea to my kids what it is... best if there is a sound to voice out the vehicles name... such as Taxi, Bus, Airplane...etc...

Hope everything work fine ...and I have to spend more time to study on it.
